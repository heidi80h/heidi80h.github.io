A career goal of mine for the future would be to become financially stable doing a job I enjoy, for instance a paramedic.In order to achieve this goal I need to go to college and complete the training and program required.Such as gaining an associate’s degree and going through programs in emergency medical technology that will help in emergency care training.This is my career goal because it would be rewarding to help people in the time of need and it can make me financially stable.

 In school I show patience when working on a certain assignment and try to be as adaptable as possible. I can be a team player and work well with others to complete a objective whether it be a group project or a simple task.If im handed a task that I don’t get on the first try I'm self motivated and persistent so I will work on it to get better at it. Another skills that i have that would be useful for this job is Im thoughtful and compassionate. I would try to understand the patient and help them to the best of my ability because i can show sympathy towards them.
</p>
</p>

For example I competed in a stem competition and it was with a group project and we all had to work together to get it done.Although we didn’t win we all improved our grades.Another way I show patience is when I was in history honors. It was quite difficult because of the fast pace  but I was motivated and determined to learn it and not fall behind.I try to use these personal qualities in everyday life.
